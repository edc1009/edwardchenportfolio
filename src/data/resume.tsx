    "I'm a curious human who builds things at the crossroads of math, code, and biology. When I'm not deep in code or wrestling with equations, you'll find me stargazing, kayaking, or on a mission to discover the next best bowl of ramen or plate of handmade pasta (I've probably tried every spot in Hong Kong). As for boba? My forever choice is \"No.1\" at Comebuytea.",
